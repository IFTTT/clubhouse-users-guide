# FAQ

### What challenges does this document address?

Challenge: Fast moving development environment with rapidly changing priorities

* Solution: Consistent use of development tools like ClubHouse across squads will provide better insights into resourcing workload, velocity and prioritization

Challenge: Tech Debt often gets overlooked or deprioritized

* Solution: All stories mapped directly to a squad for clear ownership. Additional process dictates all squads commit to 20% minimum work on Tech Debt per Impact Cycle

### Can we just adopt ClubHouse terminology and rename Impact Cycle to Milestone?

* Letâ€™s wait on this. Once ClubHouse gets more settled with naming, we can revisit. [ðŸ‘€](https://clubhouse.io/blog/clubhouse-changing-our-name-to-shortcut/)
