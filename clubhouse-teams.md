# ClubHouse Teams

## ClubHouse Team == IFTTT Squad

“Teams are a collection of Users that can be associated with work and processes within Clubhouse.”

#### Why represent squads using teams?

The folks who plan, design, build and support IFTTT are grouped together in two different ways:

* Org chart: represents the management hierarchy at IFTTT the company
* Squads: Represents how people work together on specific aspects of the IFTTT product

Since ClubHouse is a tool for managing work, it makes sense to represent the squad structure in ClubHouse and since squads are groups of people, the Team structure seems like the best fit.

#### ClubHouse Team Rules

* Each squad must have a corresponding Team in ClubHouse
  * MRR Squad
  * Flywheel Squad
  * Upgrade Squad
