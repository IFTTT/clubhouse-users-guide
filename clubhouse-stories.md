# ClubHouse Stories

## ClubHouse Story == IFTTT Story

“Stories are the standard unit of work in Clubhouse. Stories are where collaboration and documentation for said unit of work happens.” - [ClubHouse](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360016199771-What-is-a-Story-)

Stories come in various flavors as indicated by the Type attribute:

* Feature \(or Enhancement\)
  * Something new and/or improved
  * Typically flows from product team
* Bug \(or Fire\)
  * Something broken and affecting user experience directly
  * Typically flows from support or testing issues
* Chore \(aka Tech Debt\)
  * Something old and/or busted that we can live with… but shouldn’t.
  * Typically originates in engineering

### ClubHouse Story Rules

#### State

* Stories should be small enough to fit into ½ of a sprint max
  * Break up stories when they’re too big and/or convert to an epic
* Stories should be linked to one or more \(preferably one\) PR
* Story names should be short, descriptive and to the point

  * Don’t add metadata to the name, use labels instead
