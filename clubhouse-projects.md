# Shortcut Projects

## Shortcut Project == IFTTT Component or Service

“We recommend using Projects to represent key dimensions that exist within your organization or product, such as Functional Areas, Technical Components, or Product Features.”

#### Why use Projects to represent various aspects of IFTTT?

* Projects provide a mechanism to group work at a component or service level
* Projects don't have a defined start or end date
  * IFTTT components, services and business functions are also eternal… at least until they’re not

#### Shortcut Project Rules

* Projects should be scoped to very specific components, business functions or other high-level aspects of IFTTT
  * e.g. marketing, web, runtime, iOS, Android, support, design, etc.
