# Shortcut Milestones

## Shortcut Milestone == IFTTT Impact Cycle

“​​Milestones are collections of Epics that can represent a large amount of work your organization wants to do over a longer period of time, such as a month or a quarter.”

#### Why use Milestones to represent Impact Cycles?

This is a pretty straightforward mapping that allows for the grouping of stories across a large span of time.

* Milestones have start and end dates
* Milestones are a collection of epics

#### Shortcut Milestone Rules

* Each squad must have a Milestone in place to track all work per Impact Cycle
  * Naming: &lt;Squad&gt; &lt;IC&gt; \(e.g. Flywheel IC5\)
  * Start/End dates must match IC dates
