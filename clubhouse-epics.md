# ClubHouse Epics

## ClubHouse Epic == IFTTT Epic

“An Epic is a collection of Stories that represent larger initiatives.”

Epics are used in one of two ways:

1. Stories that relate to a specific initiative: a new feature, migration of a technical component, etc
   * These are traditional Epics that group stories by initiative
2. Stories that do not relate to a specific initiative: bugs, fires, tech debt, etc
   * These are buckets for stories that are typically one-off work items

#### ClubHouse Epic Rules

Epics that are related to a specific initiative:

* Milestone, start/end dates must be set if the epic is being actively worked on
* Milestone, start/end dates should be empty if the epic is backlogged

Epics that are buckets for independent stories:

* Each squad must have the following special epics to backlog bugs, fires and tech debt
  * &lt;Squad&gt; Bugs and Fires
    * e.g. MRR Squad Bugs and Fires
  * &lt;Squad&gt; Tech Debt
    * e.g. MRR Tech Debt
* Each squad must have the following special epics for in progress bugs, fires and tech debt
  * &lt;Squad&gt; &lt;Impact Cycle&gt; Bugs and Fires
    * e.g. Flywheel IC5 Bugs and Fires
  * &lt;Squad&gt; &lt;Impact Cycle&gt; &lt;Squad&gt;Tech Debt
    * e.g. Flywheel IC5 Tech Debt
