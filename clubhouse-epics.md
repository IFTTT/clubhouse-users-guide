# Shortcut Epics

## Shortcut Epic == IFTTT Epic

‚ÄúAn Epic is a collection of Stories that represent larger initiatives.‚Äù - [Shortcut](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017524632-What-is-an-Epic-#:~:text=An%20Epic%20is%20a%20collection,cross%2Dfunctional%20teams%20to%20collaborate.)

Epics are buckets used to collect stories in one of two ways:

1. Initiative Buckets

   * This is the more traditional use for epics that group stories related to a specific initiative: a new feature, migration of a technical component, etc

2. Small Work Buckets
   * These epics are implemented as a standard set of buckets to collect stories that do not relate to a specific initiative, such as: bugs, fires, tech debt, small enhancements, etc
   * These epics that act as buckets for stories that are typically one-off work items

## Shortcut Epic Rules

### Initiative Buckets

* Milestone must be set if the epic is being actively worked on
* Milestone should be empty if the epic is backlogged

### Small Work Buckets

Each squad must have the following buckets to group one-off stories

For work that is expected to be completed during the current Impact Cycle:

* &lt;Squad&gt; &lt;Impact Cycle&gt; Features
* &lt;Squad&gt; &lt;Impact Cycle&gt; Bugs and Fires
* &lt;Squad&gt; &lt;Impact Cycle&gt; Tech Debt

For work that is _not_ expected to be completed during the current Impact Cycle:

* &lt;Squad&gt; Features
* &lt;Squad&gt; Bugs and Fires
* &lt;Squad&gt; Tech Debt

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, the Flywheel squad will have 6 buckets for stories that aren't part of another epic:

For stories that are planned to be done during the current Impact Cycle

* Flywheel IC5 Features
* Flywheel IC5 Bugs and Fires
* Flywheel IC5 Tech Debt

For stories that are not planned to be done during the current Impact Cycle

* Flywheel Features
* Flywheel Bugs and Fires
* Flywheel Tech Debt
{% endhint %}

### No Personal Buckets

Be sure to always use either an epic that represents a large initiative or one of the standard 'Small Work' buckets described above. All stories should be organized in these epics to maintain visibility across the team. This way if engineers take time off, switch to other tasks or win the lottery üå¥ the work can continue with another engineer taking on the story.
